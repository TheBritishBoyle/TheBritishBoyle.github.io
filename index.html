              <h3>Queens University Undergrad Degree | Second-year Engineering Undergrad | 2020 – Present</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>As part of a team, I took part in designing and coding an app for Queens University to use to better distribute technology to Engineering students</li>
                <li>During a research project my team and I gathered information about motor torque, gear ratios and differential systems</li>
                <li>We then proceed to design, and 3D print a differential swerve drivetrain for the Queens VEX U robotics team</li>
                <li>Added to my programing language skillset by developing high-level projects in C++ while simultaneously running simulations in MATLAB</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Sir John A McDonald High School | Four Year Diploma | 2020</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Gathered knowledge on various circuit components that led me to design and construct circuit boards that I used in projects such as a robotic car, line follower, sumo bot and 3D LED cube</li>
                <li>While using both Python and Processing (Java-based IDE) I learned how to develop and debug projects. During this time, I also expanded my knowledge of Big O notation, the Mandelbrot set and sorting algorithms</li>
